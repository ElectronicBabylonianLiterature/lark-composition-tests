    "an item is shared between the two ATF flavors or specific to eBL or Oracc. This makes maintenance \n",
    "much harder because updating a rule may have uninented side effects (e.g., changing a rule for eBL \n",
    "may cause Oracc-style inputs to become unparsable) that may not become immediately apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue to consider are conflicts. Definitions may be entirely incompatible with each other\n",

    "\n",
    "Merging can also cause subtle bugs if a line is invalid within one grammar (and *should* throw \n",
    "an error) but happens to match a pattern from the other grammar (and thus gets parsed anyway, though \n",
    "not as intended). We already have an issue like that with the `translation` vs. `control` lines, \n",
    "where malformed translation lines are erroneously parsed as control lines since they happen to match\n",
